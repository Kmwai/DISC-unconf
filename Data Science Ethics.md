# Data Science Ethics

### Why are data science ethics important?
Digital advances are producing huge amounts and new forms of data, allowing computers to more quickly process this data and makes decisions without human oversight. This creates new opportunties and many new challenges we have not had to consider before

## Some Key Principles
1. Start with clear user need and public benefit - Data science offers huge opportunities to create evidence for policy making  and also make quicker and more accurate decisions. Being clear about the benefit you seek to achieve will help you justify the sensitivity of the data and the methods you want to use.

2. Use data tools which have minimum intrusion necessary - Use minimum data necessary. Sometimes you will need to use sensitive data personal data. You can take steps to safeguard peopleâ€™s privacy e.g de-identifying or aggregating data to higher levels or using synthetic data.

3. Create robust data science models - Good machine learning models can analyse far larger amounts of data far more quickly and accurately than traditional methods. We should think through the quality and representativeness of the data, flag if algorithms are using protected characteristics e.g ethnicity to make decisions, think through unintended consequences. Complex decisions may well need the wider knowledge of policy or operational experts.

4. Be alert to public perceptions - 

5. Be as open and accountable as possible - Being open allows us to talk about the benefit of data science. Be open to talk talk about the tools, data and algorithms( unless doing so would jeopardise the aim e.g fraud). Provide explanations in a plain language and give people recourse to decisions which they think are incorrectly made. Make sure your project has oversight and accountability built in throughout.

6. Keep data secure -
